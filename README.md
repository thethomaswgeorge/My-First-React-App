# My First React App #
This is my first ReactJS app to get my foot in the door of understanding how to build applications efficientlly.  Over the next few days, I will be updating this to meet the standards of the Minimal Viable Product (MVP).

It uses the [Edamam Recipe API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api) to list recipe information based on the search criteria the user enters.

MVP Goals:
- [ ] Ability to search Database
- [ ] Ability to click on a Recipe and view its contents
- [ ] Smooth minimalistic layout
